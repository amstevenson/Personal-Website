	            <p>Hi, my name is Adam Stevenson. I am a student ay Plymouth University and am from Cornwall.
	            <br><br> When I graduate, I will either undertake a masters degree, or become a Software Engineer. 
	        	<br><br>
	        	Ever since I was a child, I knew that I wanted to create innovative and technologically superior
	        	applications - however in the past the focus was mainly aimed towards video games, which has now changed. 
	        	<br><br>
	        	I always grasp any oppertunity that is available to me, no matter how huge or small, nerve-wracking or not, for the
	        	purpose of improving my general disposition and skills - which is reflected in my work-ethic and indefatigable stance towards
	        	always finding, or creating projects to work towards. 
	        	</p>

	            <p>Putting it simply, I am an individual who creates and maintains applications for clients - 
	            	such as a website, or desktop applications. <br><br>
	            	In terms of projects, I have worked with many platforms and technologies, that range from inter-network microphone communications, to
	            	mobile-devices. <br><br> My main areas of expertise are: ActionScript, C, C++. C #, Database Implementation, Database Design, Java, Mobile
	            	 Development and Website Development.  </p><br>

	         <p>When I am not busy at University, or working for a client, I like to fill my time by: 
	         	<br><br>
	         	Individual projects: The projects that I work on in my spare time are usually a result of a pursuit to learn how to code
	         	 in a different language, or the result is something that I generally think was a 'cool' idea, and was therefore implemented.
	         	 For example, I taught myself how to make websites because I thought it would be both fun and useful. Even this website, in all of its 
	         	 entirety was not inspirted by academical influences - but was of course, was the result of the idea that having one would be beneficial
	         	  in terms of when I apply for jobs, want to show case projects, or want to link friends to tutorails for specific languages.
		        <br><br>
		        Video Games: I regularly broadcast gameplay specific to non-mmo/Modern Warfare genre's. This is through a website called Twitch.tv. I have been
		        doing this actively for around three years now, and it basically comprises of a caster who hosts the content, and interacts with their audience through
		        their specific channel chatroom - and possibly other external means. 
		        <br><br>
		        Other interests include: Playing the keyboard, book reading and travelling (my favourite places would be Japan, Venice, and Egypt).
